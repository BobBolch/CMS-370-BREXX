How much does it cost

This is a FREEWARE program, as long as it is used for NON COMMERCIAL
purpose. But any generous contribution is well accepted :) to help
keeping this project alive. It is still FREEWARE if it is included
as a part (macro language) for another FREEWARE product.

For commercial use the registration fee is $50 (for version 2.0
and above). Furthermore, if you want to include it as a macro
language in one of your shareware/commercial program you have to
contact the author Vasilis.Vlachoudis@cern.ch. For more
