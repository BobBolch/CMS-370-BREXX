# Copyright waiver for https://github.com/adesutherland/CMS-370-BREXX

Please include the following statement in an email to me 
(adrian@sutherlandonline.org) to allow any significant 
contributions to this project. 

-----

I acknowledge the ownership of BREXX by Vasilis N. Vlachoudis and 
therefore this waiver only covers my contributions and changes. This 
waver does not address and is silent on the overall ownership 
of BREXX and this port except making it clear that I have relinquished 
any rights I may have had.

I dedicate any and all copyright interest in this software to the
public domain. I make this dedication for the benefit of the public at
large and to the detriment of my heirs and successors. I intend this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all
present and future rights to this software under copyright law.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, my contributions are either
originally authored by me or are derived from prior works which I have
verified are also in the public domain and are not subject to claims
of copyright by other parties.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, no individual, business,
organization, government, or other entity has any copyright interest
in my contributions, and I affirm that I will not make contributions
that are otherwise encumbered.
